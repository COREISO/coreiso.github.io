<h4>4.Modification Plan and Progress</h4>
In April 2024, Malaysia Airlines and COREISO officially launched a project to convert 9M-MRM aircraft into cargo planes. The modification process involves adjusting the aircraft structure, adding cargo equipment, and necessary system upgrades to ensure that the aircraft can meet the safety and efficiency requirements of cargo operations.

<h4>5.New operating entity MAS COREISO</h4>
In order to operate the modified 9M-MRM freighter, Malaysia Airlines and COREISO jointly established a new operating entity, MAS COREISO. This entity will be responsible for the daily operation, maintenance, and customer service of the aircraft, ensuring that it can safely and efficiently carry out cargo tasks.
<br><br>
The establishment of MAS COREISO not only marks Malaysia Airlines' further expansion in the field of air cargo, but also reflects the firm confidence and determination of both parties for future cooperation.
<br><br>
<h4>6.Operation initiation</h4>
After sufficient preparation and testing, MAS COREISO plans to officially launch the operation of 9M-MRM cargo aircraft in October 2024. This will bring new sources of revenue for Malaysia Airlines and COREISO, and help enhance their competitiveness in the air cargo market.
<br><br>
<h4>7.Conclusion</h4>
The cooperation between Malaysia Airlines and COREISO to convert the Boeing 777-200ER passenger plane into a cargo plane and establish a new operating entity, MAS COREISO, is an important measure for both sides to jointly respond to the growing demand in the global air cargo market. With the official operation of the 9M-MRM cargo aircraft, 
Malaysia Airlines and COREISO will play a more active role in the air cargo market, providing customers with more efficient and reliable cargo services.
