<h4>Report date: 2024/10/20</h4>
<br>
<h4>1.Introduction</h4>
In October 2024, MAS COREISO, as a newly established operating entity in partnership with Malaysia Airlines and COREISO, announced a major initiative to purchase retired Ferrari 296 GT3 racing cars from AF CORSE, with the aim of using them for testing and racing. This move not only reflects MAS COREISO's interest and investment in high-performance racing cars, but also indicates the company's further expansion in the racing field.
<br><br>
<h4>2.Purchase background</h4>
Since its establishment, MAS COREISO has been committed to enhancing its competitiveness in the aviation and racing fields. The purchase of the retired Ferrari 296 GT3 racing car from AF CORSE is an important layout for the company in the field of racing. The Ferrari 296 GT3, as a high-performance racing car under the Ferrari brand, has won widespread acclaim for its outstanding performance and stable track performance. As a professional team of Ferrari racing cars, AF CORSE's retired cars undoubtedly have extremely high value and potential.

<h4>3.About Ferrari 296 GT3(2022)</h4>
> Power system:<br>
The Ferrari 296 GT3 race car is equipped with a 3.0-liter V6 turbocharged engine, which is derived from a modified version of the Ferrari 296 street car. Its maximum power reaches 600 horsepower, with a peak torque of 710 Newton meters (or 712 Newton meters, depending on different sources of data). This power configuration allows the car to unleash amazing acceleration performance on the track.
<br>
In addition, the engine adopts a 120 degree angle design and tilts forward by 2 degrees, leaving space for the diffuser and optimizing aerodynamic performance. The X-trac 6-speed sequential transmission is matched with the engine, which has the characteristics of fast shifting speed and high power transmission efficiency. The clutch is electronically controlled, and it is directly controlled from the steering wheel when starting, without the traditional mechanical clutch pedal, further improving the handling and response speed of the racing car.
<br><br>
> Chassis and suspension system:<br>
The chassis of the Ferrari 296 GT3 racing car is made of a steel aluminum hybrid material, ensuring lightweight and rigidity. The chassis and roll cage are integrated together, providing additional safety protection when the vehicle is driving at high speeds. In addition, the wheelbase of the race car has been extended by 60 millimeters compared to the 296 street car, reaching 2660 millimeters, which is the maximum allowable change in wheelbase from street car to race car in the 2023 GT3 regulations, helping to increase stability in high-speed turns.
<br>
In terms of suspension system, the Ferrari 296 GT3 racing car adopts a front and rear double wishbone suspension design, and is equipped with tubular steel control arms and 5-Way adjustable shock absorbers. This suspension design can provide maximum grip even at high speeds, limiting tire pressure as much as possible, thereby increasing tire lifespan. Meanwhile, the double wishbone suspension combined with anti roll bars can provide a wide range of settings and offer different suspension tuning solutions on different mountain roads or tracks.
<br><br>
> Braking system:<br>
The braking system of the Ferrari 296 GT3 racing car has also been carefully designed and upgraded. The racing car adopts larger brake discs, with a front diameter of 400 millimeters (or 400x36 millimeters, slightly different according to different sources of data), and a corresponding increase in the size of the rear brake discs. Combined with 6-piston (or 6-piston front and 4-piston rear, slightly different according to different sources of data) brake calipers and dedicated brake ventilation ducts, it can ensure stable braking ability of the racing car during high-speed and intense driving, without any thermal attenuation.
<br><br>
> Vehicle body and aerodynamic design:<br>
The body of the Ferrari 296 GT3 racing car is made of carbon fiber material, which further reduces the weight of the car and enhances its strength. In terms of body design, the racing car is equipped with aerodynamic devices such as a front splitter, rear diffuser, and gooseneck tail. These devices have been redesigned to increase the downforce of the car by 20% compared to the 488 GT3 EVO 2020, while reducing aerodynamic sensitivity, making the car more stable during braking or acceleration.
<br><br>
<h4>4.Conclusion</h4>
The purchase of retired Ferrari 296 GT3 racing car from AF CORSE by MAS COREISO is an important step in the company's racing strategy. By fully utilizing the advanced technology and performance of racing cars, the company is expected to achieve excellent results in racing tests and competitions, further promoting the rapid development of the company in the aviation and racing fields.
