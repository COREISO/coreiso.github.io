<h4>Report date: 2024/11/07</h4>
Given the severe challenges of the current fiscal environment, 
particularly the combined impact of multiple unfavorable factors 
such as a significant decline in fiscal revenue and sustained increase in consumer spending, 
the management has decided to immediately initiate a series of emergency measures to save expenses in order to 
ensure the long-term stable operation and development of MAS COREISO. This decision aims to optimize resource allocation, 
improve financial efficiency, and jointly address the current economic difficulties. The specific measures are hereby notified as follows.
<br><br>

<h4>1.Immediate cessation of non essential entertainment consumption:</h4>
Effective immediately, all MAS COREISO members are required to suspend personal or official consumption expenditures on the Steam platform or other similar entertainment services. Although such expenses may be small, they accumulate over time, and for the current financial situation, every sub province is crucial.
<br><br>
<h4>2.Termination of Specific Project Investment and Cooperation:</h4> 
After careful evaluation, it has been decided to immediately cease all expenditures and investment activities in AF CROSE. This decision is based on a comprehensive consideration of future earnings expectations and current liquidity, with the aim of reducing potential funding risks.
<br><br>
<h4>3.Optimize freight flight operations:</h4>
In order to reduce operating costs, the freight flight frequency of MAS COREISO will be adjusted according to the actual situation. Specific measures include but are not limited to reducing flights on non emergency and low efficiency routes, as well as exploring more cost-effective logistics solutions
<br><br>
<h4>4.Reduce fuel and aircraft maintenance costs:</h4>
Given that fuel costs account for a significant proportion of operating expenses, we will renegotiate contracts with suppliers to seek more favorable procurement conditions. At the same time, strengthen aircraft maintenance management, extend equipment service life through preventive maintenance, and reduce additional expenses caused by sudden failures.
<br><br>
<hr><br>
We are well aware that the implementation of these measures may bring short-term inconvenience and challenges, but they are necessary to ensure the long-term stable development of MAS COREISO. We call on all members to understand and actively respond, and through everyone's joint efforts, overcome difficulties together to ensure that MAS can smoothly overcome the current financial difficulties.
